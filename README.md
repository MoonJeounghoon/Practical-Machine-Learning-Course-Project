# Practical Machine Learning Course Project

This repo includes the results of [Coursera's Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn) class project offered by the Johns Hopkins University.

It contains the following files:

* `eda.Rmd`: Reflects the walk through of my exploratory data analysis (EDA). It even 
includes the submission part because surprising facts about the testing set were
revealed right at the beginning of the EDA
* `train_build_model.Rmd`: Script to build and train a prediction model and to calculate the estimate of the testing set error based on cross-validation
